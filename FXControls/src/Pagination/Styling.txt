The default CSS style-class name for a Pagination control is pagination. Pagination adds several CSS
properties:
    • -fx-max-page-indicator-count
        The -fx-max-page-indicator-count property specifies the maximum number of page indicators to
        display. The default value is 10.

    • -fx-arrows-visible
       The -fx-arrows-visible property specifies whether the previous and
       next page buttons are visible. The default value is true.

    • -fx-tooltip-visible
        The -fx-tooltip-visible property specifies
        whether a tool tip is displayed when the mouse hovers over a page indicator. The default value is true.

    • -fx-page-information-visible
        The -fx-page-information-visible specifies whether the selected page label is visible. The default value
        is true.

    • -fx-page-information-alignment
        The -fx-page-information-alignment specifies the location of the selected page label relative to
        the page indicators. The possible values are top, right, bottom, and left. The default value is bottom, which
        displays the selected page indicator below the page indicators.

The Pagination control has two substructures of StackPane type:
    • page
    • pagination-control

The page substructure represents the content area. The pagination-control substructure represents
the navigation area and it has the following substructures:
    • left-arrow-button
        The left-arrow-button and right-arrow-button substructures are of the Button type. They represent
        the previous and next page buttons, respectively.
        The left-arrow-button substructure has a left-arrow
        substructure, which is a StackPane, and it represents the arrow in the previous page button.

    • right-arrow-Button
        The rightarrow-button substructure has a right-arrow substructure, which is a StackPane, and it represents the
        arrow in the next page button.

    • bullet-button
        The bullet-button is of the ToggleButton type, and
        they represent the page indicators.

    • number-button
        The number-button is of the ToggleButton type, and
        they represent the page indicators.

    • page-information
        The page-information substructure is a Label that holds the selected
        page information. The pagination-control substructure holds the previous and next page buttons and the
        page indicators in a substructure called control-box, which is an HBox.

The following styles make the selected page label invisible, set the page background to light gray, and
draw a border around the previous, next, and page indicator buttons. Please refer to the modena.css file for
more details on how to style a Pagination control.

    .pagination {
        -fx-page-information-visible: false;
    }
    .pagination > .page {

    }
    .pagination > .pagination-control > .control-box {

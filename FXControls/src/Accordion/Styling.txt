The default CSS style-class name for an Accordion is accordion. Accordion does not add any CSS
properties. It contains a first-titled-pane substructure, which is the first TitledPane. The following style
sets the background color and insets of the title bar of all TitledPanes:

    .accordion > .titled-pane > .title {
        -fx-background-color: burlywood;
        -fx-background-insets: 1;
    }

The following style sets the background color of the title bar of the first TitledPane of the Accordion:

    .accordion > .first-titled-pane > .title {
        -fx-background-color: derive(red, 80%);
    }

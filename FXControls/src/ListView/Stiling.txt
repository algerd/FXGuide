The default CSS style-class name for a ListView is list-view and for ListCell it is list-cell. The ListView
class has two CSS pseudo-classes: horizontal and vertical. The -fx-orientation CSS property controls
the orientation of the ListView, which can be set to horizontal or vertical.
You can style a ListView as you style any other controls. Each item is displayed in an instance of
ListCell. ListCellprovides several CSS pseudo-classes:
    • empty
    • filled
    • selected
    • odd
    • even

The empty pseudo-class applies when the cell is empty. The filled pseudo-class applies when the cell
is not empty. The selected pseudo-class applies when the cell is selected. The odd and even pseudo-classes
apply to cells with an odd and even index, respectively. The cell representing the first item is index 0 and it is
considered an even cell.

The following CSS styles will highlight even cells with tan and odd cells with light gray:

    .list-view .list-cell:even {
        -fx-background-color: tan;
    }

    .list-view .list-cell:odd {
        -fx-background-color: lightgray;
    }

Developers often ask how to remove the default alternate cell highlighting in a ListView. In the
modena.css file, the default background color for all list cells is set to -fx-control-inner-background,
which is a CSS-derived color. For all odd list cells, the default color is set to derive(-fx-control-innerbackground,-
5%). To keep the background color the same for all cells, you need to override the background
color of odd list cells as follows:
    .list-view .list-cell:odd {
        -fx-background-color: -fx-control-inner-background;
    }

This only solves half of the problem; it only takes care of the background colors of the list cells in a
normal state inside a ListView. A list cell can be in several states, for example, focused, selected, empty,
or filled. To completely address this, you will need to set the appropriate background colors for list cells
for all states. Please refer to the modena.css file for a complete list of states that you will need to modify the
background colors for list cells.

The ListCell class supports an -fx-cell-size CSS property that is the height of the cells in a vertical
ListView and the width of cells in a horizontal ListView.

The list cell could be of the type ListCell, TextFieldListCell, ChoiceBoxListCell,
ComboBoxListCell, or CheckBoxListCell. The default CSS style-class names for subclasses of ListCell
are text-field-list-cell, choice-box-list-cell, combo-box-list-cell, and check-box-list-cell.
You can use these style class names to customize their appearance. The following CSS style will show the
TextField in an editable ListView in yellow background:
    .list-view .text-field-list-cell .text-field {
        -fx-background-color: yellow;
    }

Tabs in a TabPane may be positioned at the top, right, bottom, or left. The side property of the TabPane
specifies the position of tabs. It is set to one of the constants of the Side enum:
    • TOP
    • RIGHT
    • BOTTOM
    • LEFT

The default value for the side property is Side.TOP. The following snippet of code creates a TabPane and
sets the side property to Side.LEFT to position tabs on the left:
    TabPane tabPane = new TabPane();
    tabPane.setSide(Side.LEFT);

Tip: The actual placement of tabs also uses the node orientation. For example, if the side property is set to
Side.LEFT and the node orientation of the TabPane is set to RIGHT_TO_LEFT, the tabs will be positioned on the
right side.

The TabPane class contains a rotateGraphic property, which is a boolean property. The property is
related to the side property. When the side property is Side.TOP or Side.BOTTOM, the graphics of all tabs in
their title bars are in the upright position. By default, when the side property changes to Side.LEFT or Side.
RIGHT, the title text is rotated, keeping the graphic upright. The rotateGraphic property specifies whether
the graphic is rotated with the text, as shown in the following code. By default, it is set to false.
    // Rotate the graphic with the text for left and right sides
    tabPane.setRotateGraphic(true);


Sizing Tabs in a TabPane:
--------------------------
TabPane divides its layout into two parts:
    • Header area
    • Content area

The header area displays the titles of tabs. The content area displays the content of the selected tab.
The size of the content area is automatically computed based on the content of all tabs. TabPane contains the
following properties that allow you to set the minimum and maximum sizes of the title bars of tabs:
    • tabMinHeight
    • tabMaxHeight
    • tabMinWidth
    • tabMaxWidth

The default values are zero for minimum width and height, and Double.MAX_VALUE for maximum width
and height. The default size is computed based on the context of the tab titles. If you want all tab titles to be
of a fixed size, set the minimum and maximum width and height to the same value. Note that for the fixed
size tabs, the longer text in the title bar will be truncated.

The following snippet of code creates a TabPane and sets the properties, so all tabs are 100px wide and 30px tall:
    TabPane tabPane = new TabPane();
    tabPane.setTabMinHeight(30);
    tabPane.setTabMaxHeight(30);
    tabPane.setTabMinWidth(100);
    tabPane.setTabMaxWidth(100);


Using Recessed and Floating TabPanes:
--------------------------------------
A TabPane can be in recessed or floating mode. The default mode is recessed mode. In the recessed mode,
it appears to be fixed. In floating mode, it appearance is changed to make it look like it is floating. In the
floating mode, the background color of the header area is removed and a border around the content area is
added. Here is a rule of thumb in deciding which mode to use:
    • If you are using a TabPane along with other controls in a window, use floating mode.
    • If the TabPane is the only one control on the window, use recessed mode.

The floating mode of a TabPane is specified by a style class. The TabPane class contains a STYLE_CLASS_
FLOATING constant. If you add this style class to a TabPane, it is in the floating mode. Otherwise, it is in the
recessed mode. The following snippet of code shows how to turn the floating mode for a TabPane on and off:

    TabPane tabPane = new TabPane();
    // Turn on the floating mode
    tabPane.getStyleClass().add(TabPane.STYLE_CLASS_FLOATING);
    ...
    // Turn off the floating mode
    tabPane.getStyleClass().remove(TabPane.STYLE_CLASS_FLOATING);

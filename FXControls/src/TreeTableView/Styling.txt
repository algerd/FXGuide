The default CSS style-class name for a TreeTableView is tree-table-view.
The default CSS style-class names for a cell, a row, and a column header are tree-table-cell, tree-table-row-cell,
and column-header, respectively. The following code shows how to set the font for cells and set the font size
and text color for column headers in a TreeTableView:

    /* Set the font for the cells */
    .tree-table-row-cell {
        -fx-font-size: 10pt;
        -fx-font-family: Arial;
    }
    /* Set the font size and text color for column headers */
    .tree-table-view .column-header .label {
        -fx-font-size: 10pt;
        -fx-text-fill: blue;
    }

TreeTableView supports the following CSS pseudo-classes:
    • cell-selection
    • row-selection
    • constrained-resize
The cell-selection pseudo-class is applied when the cell-level selection is enabled, whereas the
row-selection pseudo-class is applied for row-level selection. The constrained-resize pseudo-class is
applied when the column resize policy is CONSTRAINED_RESIZE_POLICY.

You can also set the shape of the disclosure node in CSS using the SVG path. The following styles set
plus and minus signs as the disclosure nodes for expanded and collapsed nodes, respectively:

    tree-table-row-cell .tree-disclosure-node .arrow {
        -fx-shape: "M0 -0.5 h2 v2 h1 v-2 h2 v-1 h-2 v-2 h-1 v2 h-2 v1z";
    }
    .tree-table-row-cell:expanded .tree-disclosure-node .arrow {
        -fx-shape: "M0 -0.5 h5 v-1 h-5 v1z";
        -fx-padding: 4 0.25 4 0.25;
    }

A TreeTableView contains all substructures of a TableView.

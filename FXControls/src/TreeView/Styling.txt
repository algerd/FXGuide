The default CSS style-class name for a TreeView is tree-view. TreeView does not add any CSS pseudo-classes
or properties. It inherits them from the Control.

A TreeView uses instances of TreeCell to display the TreeItems. Mostly you style the TreeCells in the
TreeView. The default CSS style-class for TreeCell is tree-cell.

TreeCell contains an -fx-indent property, which is the amount of space to multiply by the level of
the cell to get its left margin. The default value is 10px.

TreeCell supports two CSS pseudo-classes:
    • expanded
    • collapsed

The expanded pseudo-class is applied when the cell is expanded. The collapsed pseudo-class applies
when the cell is not expanded.

The following style sets the text color to blue and font size to 10pt for a TreeCell:
    .tree-cell {
        -fx-text-fill: blue;
        -fx-font-size: 10pt;
    }

The style-class name for the disclosure node in a cell is tree-disclosure-node. It has a substructure
named arrow, which is the triangle showing the expanded state of the node. You can change the triangle to
a plus or minus sign icon using the following styles. The code assumes that the image files are in the same
directory as the CSS file containing the styles:

    .tree-cell .tree-disclosure-node .arrow {
        -fx-shape: null;
        -fx-background-color: null;
        -fx-background-image: url("plus_sign.jpg");
    }
    .tree-cell:expanded .tree-disclosure-node .arrow {
        -fx-shape: null;
        -fx-background-color: null;
        -fx-background-image: url("minus_sign.jpg");
    }

You can also set the shape of the disclosure node in CSS using the SVG path. The following code sets
plus and minus signs as the disclosure nodes for expanded and collapsed nodes, respectively. Figure 14-5
shows a TreeView using these styles.

    .tree-cell .tree-disclosure-node .arrow {
        -fx-shape: "M0 -0.5 h2 v2 h1 v-2 h2 v-1 h-2 v-2 h-1 v2 h-2 v1z";
    }
    .tree-cell:expanded .tree-disclosure-node .arrow {
        -fx-shape: "M0 -0.5 h5 v-1 h-5 v1z";
        -fx-padding: 4 0.25 4 0.25;
    }

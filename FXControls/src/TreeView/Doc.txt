A TreeView is a control that displays hierarchical data in a tree-like structure.
You can think of a TreeView as displaying a tree upside down—the root of the tree being at the top. Each item
in a TreeView is an instance of the TreeItem class. TreeItems form parent-child relationships

A TreeItem is also referred to as a node. The TreeItem class does not inherit from the Node class.
Therefore, a TreeItem is not a JavaFX Node and it cannot be added to a scene graph.

A TreeItem serves as the data model in a TreeView. Each TreeItem uses an instance of the TreeCell
class to render its value. A TreeCell in a TreeView can be customized using a cell factory. By default, a
TreeCell is not editable.

TreeView is a virtualized control. It creates only as many instances of TreeCell as needed to display the
items for its current height. Cells are recycled as you scroll through items. Virtualization makes it possible
to use TreeView for viewing very large number of items without using a large amount of memory. Note,
however, that loading TreeItems always takes memory. Virtualization helps only in viewing the items by
recycling the cells used in viewing them.

The default CSS style-classes for a cell, a row, and a column header are table-cell, 
table-row-cell, and column-header, respectively:

    /* Set the font for the cells */
    .table-row-cell {
        -fx-font-size: 10pt;
        -fx-font-family: Arial;
    }
    /* Set the font size and text color for column headers */
    .table-view .column-header .label{
        -fx-font-size: 10pt;
        -fx-text-fill: blue;
    }

TableView supports the following CSS pseudo-classes:
    • cell-selection
    • row-selection
    • constrained-resize

The cell-selection pseudo-class is applied when the cell-level selection is enabled, whereas the
row-selection pseudo-class is applied for row-level selection. The constrained-resize pseudo-class is
applied when the column resize policy is CONSTRAINED_RESIZE_POLICY.

Alternate rows in a TableView are highlighted by default. The following code removes the alternate row
highlighting. It sets the white background color for all rows:

    .table-row-cell {
        -fx-background-color: white;
    }
    .table-row-cell .table-cell {
        -fx-border-width: 0.25px;
        -fx-border-color: transparent gray gray transparent;
    }

TableView shows empty rows to fill its available height. The following code removes the empty rows. In
fact, it makes them appear as removed:

    .table-row-cell:empty {
        -fx-background-color: transparent;
    }
    .table-row-cell:empty .table-cell {
        -fx-border-width: 0px;
    }

TableView contains several substructures that can be styled separately:
    • column-resize-line
    • column-overlay
    • placeholder
    • column-header-background

The column-resize-line substructure is a Region and is shown when the user tries to resize a
column. The column-overlay substructure is a Region and is shown as an overlay for the column being
moved. The placeholder substructure is a StackPane and is shown when the TableView does not have
columns or data, as in the following code:

    /* Make the text in the placeholder red and bold */
    .table-view .placeholder .label {
    -fx-text-fill: red;
    -fx-font-weight: bold;
    }

The column-header-background substructure is a StackPane, and it is the area behind the column
headers. It contains several substructures. Its filler substructure, which is a Region, is the area between the
rightmost column and the right edge of the TableView in the header area. Its show-hide-columns-button
substructure, which is a StackPane, is the area that shows the menu button to display the list of columns to
show and hide. Please refer to the modena.css file and the JavaFX CSS Reference Guide for a complete list of
properties of TableView that can be styled. The following code sets the filler background to white:
    /* Set the filler background to white*/

    .table-view .column-header-background .filler {
        -fx-background-color: white;
    }

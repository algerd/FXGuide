JavaFX provides two controls named ScrollBar and ScrollPane that provide scrolling features to other
controls. Typically, these controls are not used alone. They are used to support scrolling in other controls.

ScrollBar is a basic control that does not provide the scrolling feature by itself. It is represented as a
horizontal or vertical bar that lets users choose a value from a range of values.

A ScrollBar control consists of four parts:
• An increment button to increase the value
• A decrement button to decrease the value
• A thumb (or knob) to show the current value
• A track where the thumb moves

The increment and decrement buttons in a vertical ScrollBar are on the bottom and top, respectively.
The ScrollBar class provides a default constructor that creates a horizontal scrollbar. You can set its
orientation to vertical using the setOrientation() method:

    // Create a horizontal scroll bar
    ScrollBar hsb = new ScrollBar();
    // Create a vertical scroll bar
    ScrollBar vsb = new ScrollBar();
    vsb.setOrientation(Orientation.VERTICAL);

The min and max properties represent the range of its value. Its value property is the current value.
The default values for min, max, and value properties are 0, 100, and 0, respectively. If you are interested in
knowing when the value property changes, you need to add a ChangeListener to it. The following code
would set the value properties to 0, 200, and 150:

    ScrollBar hsb = new ScrollBar();
    hsb.setMin(0);
    hsb.setMax(200);
    hsb.setValue(150);

The current value of a scrollbar may be changed three different ways:
    • Programmatically using the setValue(), increment(), and decrement() methods
    • By the user dragging the thumb on the track
    • By the user clicking the increment and decrement buttons

The blockIncrement and unitIncrement properties specify the amount to adjust the current value
when the user clicks the track and the increment or decrement buttons, respectively. Typically, the block
increment is set to a larger value than the unit increment.

The default CSS style-class name for a ScrollBar control is scroll-bar. ScrollBar supports two CSS
pseudo-classes: horizontal and vertical. Some of its properties can be set using CSS.

ScrollBar is rarely used directly by developers. It is used to build complete controls that support
scrolling, for example, the ScrollPane control. If you need to provide scrolling capability to a control, use the
ScrollPane, which I will discuss in the next section.

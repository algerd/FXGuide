The default CSS style-class name for a SplitPane control is split-pane. SplitPane contains -fx-orientation
CSS properties, which determine its orientation. The possible values are horizontal and vertical.
SplitPane supports horizontal and vertical CSS pseudo-classes that apply to horizontal and vertical
SplitPanes, respectively. The divider is a split-pane-divider substructure of the SplitPane, which is a
StackPane. The following code sets a blue background color for dividers, 5px preferred width for dividers in
a horizontal SplitPane, and 5px preferred height for dividers in a vertical SplitPane:

    .split-pane > .split-pane-divider {
        -fx-background-color: blue;
    }

    .split-pane:horizontal > .split-pane-divider {
        -fx-pref-width: 5;
    }

    .split-pane:vertical > .split-pane-divider {
        -fx-pref-height: 5;
    }

The split-pane-divider substructure contains a grabber substructure, which is a StackPane. Its CSS
style-class name is horizontal-grabber for a horizontal SplitPane and vertical-grabber for a vertical
SplitPane. The grabber is shown in the middle of the divider.

The default CSS style-class name for a ProgressBar is progress-bar. It supports the CSS style properties:
    • -fx-indeterminate-bar-length
    • -fx-indeterminate-bar-escape
    • -fx-indeterminate-bar-flip
    • -fx-indeterminate-bar-animation-time

All properties apply to the bar that shows the indeterminate progress. The default bar length is 60px.
Use the -fx-indeterminate-bar-length property to specify a different bar length.

When the -fx-indeterminate-bar-escape property is true, the bar starting edge starts at the starting edge
of the track and the bar trailing edge ends at the ending edge of the track. That is, the bar is displayed beyond
the track length. When this property is false, the bar moves within the track length. The default value is true.

The -fx-indeterminate-bar-flip property indicates whether the bar moves only in one direction or
both. The default value is true, which means the bar moves in both directions by flipping its direction at the
end of each edge.

The -fx-indeterminate-bar-animation-time property is the time in seconds that the bar should take
to go from one edge to the other. The default value is 2.

The ProgressBar contains two substructures:
    • A track substructure, which is a StackPane
    • A bar substructure, which is a region

The following styles modify the background color and radius of the bar and track of ProgressBar:
    
    .progress-bar .track {
        -fx-background-color: lightgray;
        -fx-background-radius: 5;
    }
    
    .progress-bar .bar {
        -fx-background-color: blue;
        -fx-background-radius: 5;
    }

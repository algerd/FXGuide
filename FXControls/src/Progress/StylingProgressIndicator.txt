The default CSS style-class name for a ProgressIndicator is progress-indicator. ProgressIndicator
supports determinate and indeterminate CSS pseudo-classes. The determinate pseudo-class applies when
the indeterminate property is false. The indeterminate pseudo-class applies when the indeterminate
property is true.

ProgressIndicator has a CSS style property named -fx-progress-color, which is the color of the
progress. The following styles set the progress color to red for the indeterminate progress and blue for
determinate progress:

    .progress-indicator:indeterminate {
        -fx-progress-color: red;
    }
    .progress-indicator:determinate {
        -fx-progress-color: blue;
    }

The ProgressIndicator contains four substructures:
    • An indicator substructure, which is a StackPane
    • A progress substructure, which is StackPane
    • A percentage substructure, which is a Text
    • A tick substructure, which is a StackPane
You can style all substructures of a ProgressIndicator. Please refer to the modena.css file for sample code.


The default CSS style-class name for a ProgressBar is progress-bar. It supports the CSS style properties:
• -fx-indeterminate-bar-length
• -fx-indeterminate-bar-escape
• -fx-indeterminate-bar-flip
• -fx-indeterminate-bar-animation-time
All properties apply to the bar that shows the indeterminate progress. The default bar length is 60px.
Use the -fx-indeterminate-bar-length property to specify a different bar length.
When the -fx-indeterminate-bar-escape property is true, the bar starting edge starts at the starting edge
of the track and the bar trailing edge ends at the ending edge of the track. That is, the bar is displayed beyond
the track length. When this property is false, the bar moves within the track length. The default value is true.
The -fx-indeterminate-bar-flip property indicates whether the bar moves only in one direction or
both. The default value is true, which means the bar moves in both directions by flipping its direction at the
end of each edge.
The -fx-indeterminate-bar-animation-time property is the time in seconds that the bar should take
to go from one edge to the other. The default value is 2.
The ProgressBar contains two substructures:
• A track substructure, which is a StackPane
• A bar substructure, which is a region

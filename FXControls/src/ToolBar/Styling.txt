The default CSS style-class name for a ToolBar is tool-bar. It contains an -fx-orientation CSS property
that specifies its orientation with the possible values of horizontal and vertical. It supports horizontal and
vertical CSS pseudo-classes that apply when its orientation is horizontal and vertical, respectively.

A toolbar uses a container to arrange the items. The container is an HBox for a horizontal orientation
and a VBox for a vertical orientation. The CSS style-class name for the container is container. You can use all
CSS properties for the HBox and VBox for the container. The -fx-spacing CSS property specifies the spacing
between two adjacent items in the container. You can set this property for the toolbar or the container. Both
of the following styles have the same effect on a horizontal toolbar:

    .tool-bar {
        -fx-spacing: 2;
    }
        .tool-bar > .container {
        -fx-spacing: 2;
    }

A toolbar contains a tool-bar-overflow-button substructure to represent the overflow button. It is a
StackPane. The tool-bar-overflow-button contains an arrow substructure to represent the arrow in the
overflow button. It is also a StackPane.

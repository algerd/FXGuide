The default CSS style-class name for a ColorPicker is color-picker. You can style almost every part of a
ColorPicker, for example, color indicator, color label, color palette dialog, and custom color dialog. Please
refer to the modena.css file for complete reference.

The -fx-color-label-visible CSS property of the ColorPicker sets whether the color label is visible
or not. Its default value is true. The following code makes the color label invisible:
    .color-picker {
        -fx-color-label-visible: false;
    }

The color indicator is a rectangle, which has a style class name of picker-color-rect. The color label
is a Label, which has a style class name of color-picker-label. The following code shows the color label in
blue and sets a 2px thick black stroke around the color indicator rectangle:
    .color-picker .color-picker-label {
        -fx-text-fill: blue;
    }
    .color-picker .picker-color .picker-color-rect {
        -fx-stroke: black;
        -fx-stroke-width: 2;
    }

The style class name for the color palette is color-palette. The following code hides the Custom
Colorsâ€¦ hyperlink on the color palette:
    .color-palette .hyperlink {
        visibility: hidden;
    }

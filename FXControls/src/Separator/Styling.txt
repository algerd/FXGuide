The default CSS style-class name for a Separator control is separator. Separator contains CSS properties,
which corresponds to its Java properties:
    • -fx-orientation
    • -fx-halignment
    • -fx-valignment

Separator supports horizontal and vertical CSS pseudo-classes that apply to horizontal and vertical
separators, respectively. It contains a line substructure that is a Region. The line you see in a separator
is created by specifying the border for the line substructure. 
    .separator > .line {
        -fx-border-style: solid;
        -fx-border-width: 1;
    }

You can use an image as a separator. Set the appropriate width or height of the separator and use an
image as the background image. The following code assumes that the separator.jpg image file exists in
the same directory as the CSS file containing the style. The styles set the preferred height of the horizontal
separator and the preferred width of the vertical separator to 10px.

    .separator {
        -fx-background-image: url("separator.jpg");
        -fx-background-repeat: repeat;
        -fx-background-position: center;
        -fx-background-size: cover;
    }
    .separator:horizontal {
        -fx-pref-height: 10;
    }
    .separator:vertical {
        -fx-pref-width: 10;
    }

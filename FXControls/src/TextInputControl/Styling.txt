The TextInputControl class introduces a CSS pseudo-class named readonly, which applies when the
control is not editable. It adds the following style properties:
    • -fx-font
    • -fx-text-fill
    • -fx-prompt-text-fill
    • -fx-highlight-fill
    • -fx-highlight-text-fill
    • -fx-display-caret

The -fx-font property is inherited from the parent by default. The value for the -fx-display-caret
property could be true or false. When it is true, the caret is displayed when the control has focus. Otherwise,
the caret is not displayed. Its default value is true. Most of the other properties affect background and
text colors.

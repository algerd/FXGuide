The default CSS style-class name for a TextArea is text-area. It does not add any CSS properties to the
ones present in its ancestor TextInputControl. It contains scroll-pane and content substructures, which
are a ScrollPane and a Region, respectively. The scroll-pane is the scroll pane that appears when its text
exceeds its width or height. The content is the region that displays the text.

The following styles set the horizontal and vertical scrollbar policies to always, so the scrollbars should
always appear in TextArea. Padding for the content area is set to 10px:

    .text-area > .scroll-pane {
        -fx-hbar-policy: always;
        -fx-vbar-policy: always;
    }

    .text-area .content {
        -fx-padding: 10;
    }

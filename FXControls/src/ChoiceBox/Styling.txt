The default CSS style-class name for a ChoiceBox is choice-box. The ChoiceBox class supports a showing
CSS pseudo-class, which applies when the showing property is true.

The ChoiceBox control contains two substructures: open-button and arrow. You can style them to
change their appearance. Both are instances of StackPane. ChoiceBox shows the selected item in a Label.
The list of choices are shown in a ContextMenu whose ID is set to choice-box-popup-menu. Each choice is
displayed in a menu item whose IDs are set to choice-box-menu-item. The following styles customize the
ChoiceBox control. Currently, there is no way to customize the pop-up menu for an individual choice box.
The style will affect all instances of ChoiceBox control at the level (scene or layout pane) at which it is set.

/* Set the text color and font size for the selected item in the control */
.choice-box .label {
    -fx-text-fill: blue;
    -fx-font-size: 8pt;
}

/* Set the text color and text font size for choices in the popup list */
#choice-box-menu-item * {
    -fx-text-fill: blue;
    -fx-font-size: 8pt;
}

/* Set background color of the arrow */
.choice-box .arrow {
    -fx-background-color: blue;
}

/* Set the background color for the open-button area */
.choice-box .open-button {
    -fx-background-color: yellow;
}

/* Change the background color of the popup */
#choice-box-popup-menu {
    -fx-background-color: yellow;
}

Tip: T here is a bug in applying the styles to the ChoiceBox pop-up. Styles are not effective until the pop-up
is opened twice.

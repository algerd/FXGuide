The default CSS style-class name for a ComboBox is combo-box. A combo box contains several CSS
substructures, as shown in Figure "Substructures of a combo box that can be styled separately using CSS.png".

The CSS names for the substructure are:
    • arrow-button
    • list-cell
    • text-input
    • combo-box-popup

An arrow-button contains a substructure called arrow. Both arrow-button and arrow are instances of
StackPane. The list-cell area represents the ListCell used to show the selected item in a noneditable
combo box. The text-input area is the TextField used to show the selected or entered item in an editable
combo box. The combo-box-popup is the Popup control that shows the pop-up list when the button is clicked.
It has two substructures: list-view and list-cell. The list-view is the ListView control that shows the
list of items, and list-cell represents each cell in the ListView. The following CSS styles customize the
appearance of some substructures of ComboBox:

    /* The ListCell that shows the selected item in a non-editable ComboBox */
    .combo-box .list-cell {
        -fx-background-color: yellow;
    }

    /* The TextField that shows the selected item in an editable ComboBox */
    .combo-box .text-input {
        -fx-background-color: yellow;
    }

    /* Style the arrow button area */
    .combo-box .arrow-button {
        -fx-background-color: lightgray;
    }

    /* Set the text color in the popup list for ComboBox to blue */
    .combo-box-popup .list-view .list-cell {
        -fx-text-fill: blue;
    }

The default CSS style-class name for a TitledPane is titled-pane. TitledPane adds two style properties
of boolean type:
    • -fx-animated
    • -fx-collapsible
The default values for both properties are true. The -fx-animated property indicates whether the
expanding and collapsing actions are animated. The -fx-collapsible property indicates whether
the control can be collapsed.

TitledPane supports two CSS pseudo-classes:
    • collapsed
    • expanded
The collapsed pseudo-class applies when the control is collapsed and the expanded pseudo-class
applies when it is expanded.

TitledPane contains two substructures:
    • title
    • Content
The title substructure is a StackPane that contains the content of the title bar. The title substructure
contains text and arrow-button substructures. The text substructure is a Label and it holds the title text and
the graphic. The arrow-button substructure is a StackPane that contains an arrow substructure, which is
also a StackPane. The arrow substructure is an indicator that shows whether the control is in an expanded or
collapsed state. The content substructure is a StackPane that contains the content of the control.

Let’s look at an example of the effects of applying the four different styles to a TitledPane control, as
presented in the following code:

    /* #1 */
    .titled-pane > .title {
        -fx-background-color: lightgray;
        -fx-alignment: center-right;
    }

    /* #2 */
    .titled-pane > .title > .text {
        -fx-font-size: 14px;
        -fx-underline: true;
    }

    /* #3 */
    .titled-pane > .title > .arrow-button > .arrow {
        -fx-background-color: blue;
    }

    /* #4 */
    .titled-pane > .content {
        -fx-background-color: burlywood;
        -fx-padding: 10;
    }

Style #1 sets the background color of the title to light gray and places the graphic and title at the center
right in the title bar. Style #2 changes the font size of the title text to 14px and underlines it. Setting the text
color of the title using the -fx-text-fill property does not work at the time of this writing and setting the
-fx-text-fill property on the TitledPane itself affects the text color of the content as well. Style #3 sets the
background color of the arrow to blue. Style #4 sets the background color and padding of the content region.

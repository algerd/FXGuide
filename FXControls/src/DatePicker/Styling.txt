The default CSS style-class name for a DatePicker is date-picker, and for its pop-up, the class name is
date-picker-popup. You can style almost every part of a DatePicker, for example, the month-year pane in
the top area of the pop-up, day cells, week number cells, and current day cell. Please refer to the modena.css
file for complete reference.

The CSS style-class name for day cell is day-cell. The day cell for the current date has the style-class
name as today. The following styles display the current day number in bold and all day numbers in blue:

    /* Display current day numbers in bolder font */
    .date-picker-popup > * > .today {
        -fx-font-weight: bolder;
    }

    /* Display all day numbers in blue */
    .date-picker-popup > * > .day-cell {
        -fx-text-fill: blue;
    }

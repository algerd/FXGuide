The default CSS style-class name for a ContextMenu is context-menu. Please refer to the modena.css file
for sample styles for customizing the appearance of context menus. By default, a context menu uses a drop
shadow effect. The following style sets the font size to 8pt and removes the default effect:

    .context-menu {
        -fx-font-size: 8pt;
        -fx-effect: null;
    }

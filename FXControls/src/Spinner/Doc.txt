A spinner is a single-line text field control that lets the user select a number 
or an object value from an ordered sequence of such values. Spinners typically provide 
a pair of tiny arrow buttons for stepping through the elements of the sequence. 
The keyboard's up arrow/down arrow keys also cycle through the elements. 
The user may also be allowed to type a (legal) value directly into the spinner. 
Although combo boxes provide similar functionality, spinners are sometimes preferred 
because they don't require a drop-down list that can obscure important data, 
and also because they allow for features such as wrapping from the maximum value 
back to the minimum value (e.g., from the largest positive integer to 0).

A spinner is implemented as an instance of the javafx.scene.control.Spinner control class. 
This class relies on the abstract javafx.scene.control.SpinnerValueFactory class to provide the control's model 
(range of user-selectable values of a specific type). 
Currently, the only supported models are defined by its nested DoubleSpinnerValueFactory, IntegerSpinnerValueFactory, and ListSpinnerValueFactory classes.

You create a spinner by calling one of Spinner's constructors. 
For example, Spinner(int min, int max, int initialValue) creates a spinner for selecting one of the integer values from min through max. 
The initially selected value is identified by initialValue. If this value isn't in the min/max range, min's value becomes the initially selected value.

Spinner(int min, int max, int initialValue) is a convenience constructor that installs an instance of the IntegerSpinnerValueFactory class with these values as the model. 
If you prefer to work directly with IntegerSpinnerValueFactory, you can instantiate this class and pass its reference to the Spinner(SpinnerValueFactory<T> valueFactory) constructor. 
Alternatively, you can create an empty spinner via the Spinner() constructor and invoke Spinner's void setValueFactory(SpinnerValueFactory<T> value) method to install this factory object.

 
CSS Pseudo-class:

editable	
	Values: <boolean>
	Default: false
	Field: BooleanProperty editable
	Property: BooleanProperty editableProperty()
	Methods: isEditable(), setEditable(boolean)
	Description:
		Applies when the editable variable is true.
		Specifies whether the ComboBox allows for user input. When editable is true, the ComboBox has a text input area that a user may type in to. 
		This input is then available via the value property.
		Note that when the editable property changes, the value property is reset, along with any other relevant state.

showing	
	Values: <boolean>
	Default: false
	Field: ReadOnlyBooleanWrapper showing
	Property: ReadOnlyBooleanProperty showingProperty()
	Methods: isShowing()
	Description:
		Applies when the showing variable is true.
		Represents the current state of the ComboBox popup, and whether it is currently visible on screen (although it may be hidden behind other windows).

armed	
	Values: <boolean>
	Default: false
	Field: BooleanProperty armed
	Property: BooleanProperty armedProperty()
	Methods: isArmed()
	Description:
		Applies when the armed variable is true.
		Indicates that the ComboBox has been "armed" such that a mouse release will cause the ComboBox show() method to be invoked. 
		This is subtly different from pressed. Pressed indicates that the mouse has been pressed on a Node and has not yet been released. 
		arm however also takes into account whether the mouse is actually over the ComboBox and pressed.

-fx-orientation		
	Values: [ horizontal | vertical ]
	Default: vertical
	Field: ObjectProperty<Orientation> orientation
	Property: ObjectProperty<Orientation> orientationProperty()
	Methods: getOrientation(), setOrientation(Orientation)
	Description:
		The orientation of the ListView - this can either be horizontal or vertical.
	
	
-fx-fixed-cell-size
	Values: <number>
	Default:
	Field: DoubleProperty fixedCellSize
	Property: DoubleProperty fixedCellSizeProperty()
	Methods: getFixedCellSize(), setFixedCellSize(double)
	Description:
		Specifies whether this control has cells that are a fixed height (of the specified value). 
		If this value is less than or equal to zero, then all cells are individually sized and positioned. 
		This is a slow operation. Therefore, when performance matters and developers are not dependent on 
		variable cell sizes it is a good idea to set the fixed cell size value. 
		Generally cells are around 24px, so setting a fixed cell size of 24 is likely to result in very little difference in visuals, 
		but a improvement to performance.
		To set this property via CSS, use the -fx-fixed-cell-size property. This should not be confused with the -fx-cell-size property. 
		The difference between these two CSS properties is that -fx-cell-size will size all cells to the specified size, 
		but it will not enforce that this is the only size (thus allowing for variable cell sizes, and preventing the performance gains from being possible). 
		Therefore, when performance matters use -fx-fixed-cell-size, instead of -fx-cell-size. If both properties are specified in CSS, 
		-fx-fixed-cell-size takes precedence.

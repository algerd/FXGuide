armed	
	Values: <boolean>
	Default: false
	Field: ReadOnlyBooleanWrapper armed
	Property: ReadOnlyBooleanProperty armedProperty()
	Methods: isArmed()
	Description:
		Applies when the armed variable is true.
		Indicates that the button has been "armed" such that a mouse release will cause the button's action to be invoked. 
		This is subtly different from pressed. Pressed indicates that the mouse has been pressed on a Node and has not yet been released. 
		arm however also takes into account whether the mouse is actually over the button and pressed.

All properties, except the data property, defined in the PieChart class, can be styled using CSS as shown below.
    .chart {
        -fx-clockwise: false;
        -fx-pie-label-visible: true;
        -fx-label-line-length: 10;
        -fx-start-angle: 90;
    }

Four style classes are added to each pie slice added to a pie chart:
    • chart-pie
    • data<i>
    • default-color<j>
    • negative
The <i> in the style-class name data<i> is the slice index. The first slice has the class data0, the second
data1, the third data2, etc.
The <j> in the style-class name default-color<j> is the color index of the series. In a pie chart, you can
think of each slice as a series. The default CSS (Modena.css) defines eight series colors. If your pie slice has
more than eight slices, the slice color will be repeated. 

The negative style-class is added only when the data for the slice is negative.

Define a style for chart-pie style-class-name if you want that style to apply to all pie slices. The following
style will set a white border with 2px of background insets for all pie slices. It will show a wider gap between
two slices as you have set 2px insets.
    .chart-pie {
        -fx-border-color: white;
        -fx-background-insets: 2;
    }

You can define colors for pie slices using the following styles. It defines colors for only five slices. Slices
beyond the sixth one will use default colors.
    .chart-pie.default-color0 {-fx-pie-color: red;}
    .chart-pie.default-color1 {-fx-pie-color: green;}
    .chart-pie.default-color2 {-fx-pie-color: blue;}
    .chart-pie.default-color3 {-fx-pie-color: yellow;}
    .chart-pie.default-color4 {-fx-pie-color: tan;}

The abstract Chart is the base class for all charts. It inherits the Node class. Charts can be added to a scene
graph. They can also be styled with CSS as any other nodes. 
JavaFX divides charts into two categories:
    • Charts having no-axis
    • Charts having an x-axis and a y-axis
The PieChart class falls into the first category. It has no axis, and it is used to draw a pie chart.
The XYChart class falls into the second category. It is the abstract base class for all charts having two
axes. Its subclasses, for example, LineChart, BarChart, etc., represent specific type of charts.

Every chart in JavaFX has three parts:
    • A title
    • A legend
    • Content (or data)

Different types of charts define their data differently. The Chart class contains the following properties
that are common to all types of charts:
    • title
    • titleSide
    • legend
    • legendSide
    • legendVisible
    • animated
The title property specifies the title for a chart. The titleSide property specifies the location of the
title. By default, the title is placed above the chart content. Its value is one of the constants of the Side enum:
TOP (default), RIGHT, BOTTOM, and LEFT.

Typically, a chart uses different types of symbols to represent data in different categories. A legend
lists symbols with their descriptions. The legend property is a Node and it specifies the legend for the chart.
By default, a legend is placed below the chart content. The legendSide property specifies the location of
the legend, which is one of the constants of the Side enum: TOP, RIGHT, BOTTOPM (default), and LEFT. The
legendVisible property specifies whether the legend is visible. By default, it is visible.

The animated property specifies whether the change in the content of the chart is shown with some
type of animation. By default, it is true.

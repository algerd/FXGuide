You can style all types of charts. The Chart class defines properties common to all types of charts. The
default CSS style-class name for a chart is chart. You can specify the legendSide, legendVisible, and
titleSide properties for all charts in a CSS as shown:

    .chart {
        -fx-legend-side: top;
        -fx-legend-visible: true;
        -fx-title-side: bottom;
    }

Every chart defines two substructures:
    • chart-title
    • chart-content
The chart-title is a Label and the chart-content is a Pane. The following styles sets the background
color for all charts to yellow and the title font to Arial 16px bold.

    .chart-content {
        -fx-background-color: yellow;
    }
    .chart-title {
        -fx-font-family: "Aeial";
        -fx-font-size: 16px;
        -fx-font-weight: bold;
    }

The default style-class name for legends is chart-legend. The following style sets the legend background
color to light gray.

    .chart-legend {
        -fx-background-color: lightgray;
    }

Every legend has two substructures:
    • chart-legend-item
    • chart-legend-item-symbol

The chart-legend-item is a Label, and it represents the text in the legend. The chart-legend-itemsymbol
is a Node, and it represents the symbol next to the label, which is a circle by default. The following
style sets the font size for the labels in legends to 10px and the legend symbols to an arrow.

    .chart-legend-item {
        -fx-font-size: 16px;
    }
    .chart-legend-item-symbol {
        -fx-shape: "M0 -3.5 v7 l 4 -3.5z";
    }

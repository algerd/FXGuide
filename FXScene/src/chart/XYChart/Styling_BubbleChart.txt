The BubbleChart is not assigned any additional style-class name other than chart.
You can customize the appearance of the bubbles for each series or each data item in a series. Each data
item in a BubbleChart is represented by a node. The node gets four default style-class names:
    • chart-bubble
    • series<i>
    • data<j>
    • default-color<k>

Here, <i> is the series index, <j> is the data item index within a series, and <k> is the color index of
the series.

Each series is assigned a legend item, which gets the following style-class names:
• chart-bubble
• series<i>
• bubble-legend-symbol
• default-color<k>
Here, <i> and <k> have the same meanings as described above.

The following style sets the fill color for the series color index 0 to blue. The bubbles and legend symbols
for the data items in the first series will be displayed in blue. The color will repeat for series index 8, 16, 24, etc.
    
    .chart-bubble.default-color0 {
        -fx-bubble-fill: blue;
    }

By default, a BarChart is given style-class names: chart and bar-chart.
The following style sets the default values for the barGap and categoryGap properties for all bar charts
to 0px and 20px. The bars in the same category will be placed next to each other.
    
    .bar-chart {
        -fx-bar-gap: 0;
        -fx-category-gap: 20;
    }

You can customize the appearance of the bars for each series or each data item in a series. Each data
item in a BarChart is represented by a node. The node gets four default style-class names:
    • chart-bar
    • series<i>
    • data<j>
    • default-color<k>
    • negative

In series<i>, <i> is the series index. For example, the first series is given the style-class name as
series0, the second as series1, etc.

In data<j>, <j> is the index of the data item within a series. For example, the first data item in each
series gets a style-class name as data0, the second as data1, etc.

In default-color<k>, <k> is the series color index. For example, each data item in the first series will
get a style-class name as default-color0, in the second series default-color1, etc. The default CS defines
only eight series colors. The value for <k> is equal to (i%8), where i is the series index. That is, series colors
will repeat if you have more than eight series in a bar chart. Please refer to the pie chart section on how to
use unique colors for series with index greater than eight. The logic will be similar to the one used for a pie
chart, with a difference that, this time, you will be looking up the bar-legend-symbol within a series instead
of a pie-legend-symbol.

The negative class is added if the data value is negative.
Each legend item in a bar chart is given the following style-class names:
    • chart-bar
    • series<i>
    • bar-legend-symbol
    • default-color<j>

In series<i>, <i> is the series index. In default-color<j>, <j> is the color index of the series.
The legend color will repeat, as the bar colors do, if the number of series exceeds 8.
The following style defines the color of the bars for the all data items in series with series index 0, 8,
16, 24, etc., as blue.

    .chart-bar.default-color0 {
        -fx-bar-fill: blue;
    }

The LineChart is not assigned any additional style-class name other than chart. The following style specifies
that the LineChart should not create symbols.
    .chart {
        -fx-create-symbols: false;
    }

The LineChart creates a Path node to show the lines connecting all data points for a series. A line for
a series is assigned the following style-class names:
    • chart-series-line
    • series<i>
    • default-color<j>
Here, <i> is the series index and <j> is the color index of the series.

If the createSymbols property is set to true, a symbol is created for each data point. Each symbol node
is assigned the following style-class name:
    • chart-line-symbol
    • series<i>
    • data<j>
    • default-color<k>
Here, <i> is the series index, <j> is the data item index within a series, and <k> is the color index
of the series.

Each series is assigned a legend item, which gets the following style-class names:
    • chart-line-symbol
    • series<i>
    • default-color<j>

The following styles set the line stroke for the color index 0 of series to blue. The symbol is for the series
is also shown in blue.

    .chart-series-line.default-color0 {
        -fx-stroke: blue;
    }
    .chart-line-symbol.default-color0 {
        -fx-background-color: blue, white;
    }

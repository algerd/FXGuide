By default, a StackedBarChart is given style-class names: chart and stacked-bar-chart.
The following style sets the default value for the categoryGap properties for all stacked bar charts to
20px. The bars in a category will be placed next to each other.

    .stacked-bar-chart {
        -fx-category-gap: 20;
    }

In a stacked bar chart, the style-class names assigned to the nodes representing bars and legend items
are the same as that of a bar chart. Please refer to Styling_BarChart.txt for more details.

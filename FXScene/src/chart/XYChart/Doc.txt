    Representing Axes in an XYChart:
---------------------------------------

An instance of a concrete subclass of the abstract Axis<T> class defines an axis in the XYChart.

abstract Axis<T>
    abstract ValueAxis<T>
        NumberAxis
    CategoryAxis

The abstract Axis<T> class is the base class for all classes representing axes. The generic parameter T is
the type of the values plotted along the axis, for example, String, Number, etc. An axis displays ticks and tick
labels. The Axis<T> class contains properties to customize the ticks and tick labels. An axis can have a label,
which is specified in the label property.

The concrete subclasses CategoryAxis and NumberAxis are used for plotting String and Number
data values along an axis, respectively. They contain properties specific to the data values. For example,
NumberAxis inherits ValueAxis<T> ’s lowerBound and upperBound properties, which specify the lower and
upper bounds of the data plotted on the axis. By default, the range of the data on an axis is automatically
determined based on the data. You can turn off this feature by setting the autoRanging property in
the Axis<T> class to false. The following snippet of code creates an instance of the CategoryAxis and
NumberAxis and sets their labels.

    CategoryAxis xAxis = new CategoryAxis();
    xAxis.setLabel("Country");
    NumberAxis yAxis = new NumberAxis();
    yAxis.setLabel("Population (in millions)");

Tip: Use a CategoryAxis to plot String values along an axis, and use a NumberAxis to plot numeric values
along an axis.

Tip: Each bar in a bar chart is represented with a node. The user can interact with the bars in a bar chart,
by adding event handlers to the nodes representing the data items. Please refer to the PieSliceTest.java 
on the pie chart for an example in which you added tooltips for the pie slices.

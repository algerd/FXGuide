The ScatterChart is not assigned any additional style-class name other than chart.
You can customize the appearance of the symbols for each series or each data item in a series. Each
data item in a ScatterChart is represented by a node. The node gets four default style-class names:
    • chart-symbol
    • series<i>
    • data<j>
    • default-color<k>
    • negative
Please refer to the section Styling the BarChart with CSS for more details on the meanings of <i>, <j>,
and <k> in these style-class names.

Each legend item in a scatter chart is given the following style-class names:
    • chart-symbol
    • series<i>
    • data<j>
    • default-color<k>

The following style will display the data items in the first series as triangles filled in blue. Note that
only eight color series are defined. After that, colors are repeated as discussed at length in the section on
the pie chart.

    .chart-symbol.default-color0 {
        -fx-background-color: blue;
        -fx-shape: "M5, 0L10, 5L0, 5z";
    }

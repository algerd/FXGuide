The AreaChart is not assigned any additional style-class name other than chart. The following style specifies
that the AreaChart should not create symbols for representing the data points.

    .chart {
        -fx-create-symbols: false;
    }

Each series in an AreaChart is represented by a Group containing two Path nodes. One Path represents
the line segment connecting all data points in the series, and another Path represents the area covered by
the series. The Path node representing the line segment for a series is assigned the following style-class
names:
    • chart-series-area-line
    • series<i>
    • default-color<j>
Here, <i> is the series index and <j> is the color index of the series.

The Path node representing the area for a series is assigned the following style-class names:
    • chart-series-area-fill
    • series<i>
    • default-color<j>
Here, <i> is the series index and <j> is the color index of the series.

If the createSymbols property is set to true, a symbol is created for each data point. Each symbol node
is assigned the following style-class name:
    • chart-area-symbol
    • series<i>
    • data<j>
    • default-color<k>
Here, <i> is the series index, <j> is the data item index within a series, and <k> is the color index
of the series.

Each series is assigned a legend item, which gets the following style-class names:
    • chart-area-symbol
    • series<i>
    • area-legend-symbol
    • default-color<j>
Here, <i> is the series index and <j> is the color index of the series.

The following style sets the area fill color for the color index 0 for the series to blue with 20% opacity.
Make sure to set transparent colors for the area fills as areas overlap in an AreaChart.

    .chart-series-area-fill.default-color0 {
        -fx-fill: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.20);
    }

The following styles set the blue as the color for symbols, line segment, and legend symbol for the color
index 0 for the series.

    /* Data point symbols color */
    .chart-area-symbol.default-color0. {
        -fx-background-color: blue, white;
    }
    /* Series line segment color */
    .chart-series-area-line.default-color0 {
        -fx-stroke: blue;
    }
    /* Series legend symbol color */
    .area-legend-symbol.default-color0 {
        -fx-background-color: blue, white;
    }

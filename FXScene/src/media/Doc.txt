AudioClip is used to play a short audio clip with minimal latency. Typically, this is useful for sound
effects, which are usually short audio clips. Use the Media, MediaPlayer, and MediaView classes for playing
audios and videos of longer length.

The Media and MediaPlayer classes are used to play audios as well as videos. An instance of the Media
class represents a media resource, which could be an audio or video. It provides the information about the
media, for example, the duration of the media. An instance of the MediaPlayer class provides controls for
playing a media.

An instance of the MediaView class provides the view of a media being played by a MediaPlayer.
A MediaView is used for viewing a video.

Several things can go wrong when you attempt to play a media, for example, the media format may
not be supported or the media content may be corrupt. An instance of the MediaException class represents
a specific type of media error that may occur during media playback. When a media-related error occurs,
a MediaErrorEvent is generated. You can handle the error by adding an appropriate event handler to the
media objects.

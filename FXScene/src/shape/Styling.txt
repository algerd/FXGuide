All shapes do not have a default style-class name. If you want to apply styles to shapes using CSS, you need
to add style-class names to them. All shapes can use the following CSS properties:
    • -fx-fill
    • -fx-smooth
    • -fx-stroke
    • -fx-stroke-type
    • -fx-stroke-dash-array
    • -fx-stroke-dash-offset
    • -fx-stroke-line-cap
    • -fx-stroke-line-join
    • -fx-stroke-miter-limit
    • -fx-stroke-width

All CSS properties correspond to the properties in the Shape class, which I have discussed at length in
the previous section. Rectangle supports two additional CSS properties to specify arc width and height for
rounded rectangles:
    • -fx-arc-height
    • -fx-arc-width

The following snippet of code creates a Rectangle and adds rectangle as its style-class name:
    
    Rectangle r1 = new Rectangle(200, 50);
    r1.getStyleClass().add("rectangle");

The following style will produce a rectangle:
    
    .rectangle {
        -fx-fill: lightgray;
        -fx-stroke: black;
        -fx-stroke-width: 4;
        -fx-stroke-dash-array: 15 5 5 10;
        -fx-stroke-dash-offset: 20;
        -fx-stroke-line-cap: round;
        -fx-stroke-line-join: bevel;
    }

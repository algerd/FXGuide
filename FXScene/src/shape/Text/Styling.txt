A Text node does not have a default CSS style-class name. In addition to all CSS properties of the Shape,
a Text node supports the following CSS properties:
    • -fx-font
    • -fx-font-smoothing-type
    • -fx-text-origin
    • -fx-text-alignment
    • -fx-strikethrough
    • -fx-underline

The -fx-font property is inherited from the parent. 
If the parent does not set the property, the default system font is used. The valid values for the
-fx-font-smoothing-type property are lcd and gray. The valid values for the -fx-text-origin property are
baseline, top, and bottom. Let us create a style named my-text as follows. It sets a font and a linear gradient
fill. The fill starts as a light gray color and ends as black.

    .my-text {
        -fx-font: 36 Arial;
        -fx-fill: linear-gradient(from 0% 0% to 100% 0%, lightgray 0%, black 100%);
        -fx-font-smoothing-type: lcd;
        -fx-underline: true;
    }

    //creates a Text node and sets it style-class name to my-text.
    Text t1 = new Text("Styling Text Nodes!");
    t1.getStyleClass().add("my-text");

Every node has a geometric shape and it is positioned in a coordinate space. The size and the position
of a node are collectively known as its bounds. The bounds of a node are defined in terms of a bounding
rectangular box that encloses the entire geometry of the node.

An instance of the javafx.geometry.Bounds class represents the bounds of a node. The Bounds class
is an abstract class. The BoundingBox class is a concrete implementation of the Bounds class. The Bounds
class is designed to handle bounds in a 3D space. It encapsulates the coordinates of the upper left corner
with the minimum depth in the bounding box and the width, height, and depth of the bounding box. The
methods getMinX(), getMinY(), and getMinZ() are used to get the coordinates. The three dimensions of the
bounding box are accessed using the getWidth() getHeight(), and getDepth() methods. The Bounds class
contains the getMaxX() getMaxY() and getMaxZ() methods that return the coordinates of the lower right
corner, with the maximum depth, in the bounding box.

In a 2D space, the minX and minY define the x and y coordinates of the upper left corner of the
bounding box, respectively, and the maxX and maxY define the x and y coordinates of the lower right corner,
respectively. In a 2D space, the values of the z coordinate and the depth for a bounding box are zero.

The Bounds class contains isEmpty(), contains(), and intersects() utility methods. The isEmpty()
method returns true if any of the three dimensions (width, height, or depth) of a Bounds is negative. The
contains() method lets you check if a Bounds contains another Bounds, a 2D point, or a 3D point. The
intersects() method lets you check if the interior of a Bounds intersects the interior of another Bounds, a 2D
point, or a 3D point.

A node in a scene graph has three types of bounds defined as three read-only properties in the Node class:
    • layoutBounds
    • boundsInLocal
    • boundsInParent

When you are trying to understand the three types of the bounds of a node, you need to look for
three points:
    • How the (minX, minY) values are defined. They define the coordinates of the upper
    left corner of the bounding box described by the Bounds object.
    • Remember that coordinates of a point are always defined relative to a coordinate
    space. Therefore, pay attention to the coordinate space in which the coordinates, as
    described in the first step, are defined.
    • What properties of the node—geometry, stroke, effects, clip, and transformations—
    are included in a particular type of bounds.

Table lists the properties that contribute to a particular type of the bounds of a node and the
coordinate space in which the bounds are defined. The boundsInLocal and boundsInParent of a node
are also known as its physical bounds as they correspond to the physical properties of the node. The
layoutBounds of a node is known as the logical bounds as it is not necessarily tied to the physical bounds of
the node. When the geometry of a node is changed, all bounds are recomputed.

Contributing Properties to the Bounds of a Node:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bounds Type         Coordinate Space            Contributors
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
layoutBounds    Node (Untransformed)            Geometry of the node
                                                Nonzero stroke

boundsInLocal   Node (Untransformed)            Geometry of the node
                                                Nonzero stroke
                                                Effects
                                                Clip

boundsInParent  Parent                          Geometry of the node
                                                Nonzero stroke
                                                Effects
                                                Clip
                                                Transformations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tip: T he boundsInLocal and BoundsInParent are known as physical or visual bounds as they correspond
to how the node looks visually. The layoutBounds is also known as the logical bounds as it does
not necessarily
correspond to the physical bounds of the node.

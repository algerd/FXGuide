The addListener() and removeListener() methods in the ObservableList interface allow you to add
and remove ListChangeListeners, respectively. Other methods perform operations on the list, which affect
multiple elements.

If you want to receive notifications when changes occur in an ObservableList, you need to add a
ListChangeListener interface whose onChanged() method is called when a change occurs in the list. The
Change class is a static inner class of the ListChangeListener interface. A Change object contains a report of
the changes in an ObservableList. It is passed to the onChanged() method of the ListChangeListener.

You can add or remove invalidation listeners to or from an ObservableList using the following two
methods that it inherits from the Observable interface:
    • void addListener(InvalidationListener listener)
    • void removeListener(InvalidationListener listener)
Note that an ObservableList contains all of the methods of the List interface as it inherits them from
the List interface.

JavaFX library provides two classes named FilteredList and SortedList that are in the
javafx.collections.transformation package. A FilteredList is an ObservableList that filters its
contents using a specified Predicate. A SortedList sorts its contents.

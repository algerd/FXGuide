The observable collections in JavaFX have two additional features:
    • They support invalidation notifications as they are inherited from the Observable interface.
    • They support change notifications. You can register change listeners to them, which
        are notified when their contents change.

The javafx.collections.FXCollections class is a utility class to work with JavaFX collections. It
consists of all static methods.

JavaFX does not expose the implementation classes of observable lists, sets, maps and arrays. You need
to use one of the factory methods in the FXCollections class to create objects of the ObservableList,
ObservableSet, ObservableMap and ObservableArray interfaces.

In simple terms, an observable collection in JavaFX is a list, set, map or array that may be observed for
invalidation and content changes.

For the example here, you will develop a GUI application that will let the user enter the details of a person,
validate the data, and save it. The form should contain:
    • Person ID field: An autogenerated unique noneditable field
    • First name field: An editable text field
    • Last name field: An editable text field
    • Birth date: An editable text field
    • Age category: An autocomputed noneditable field based on the birth date
    • Save button: A button to save the data
    • Close button: A button to close the window

The personal data should be validated against the following rules:
    • The first and last names must be at least one character long.
    • If a birth date is entered, it must not be a future date.

Three classes will represent the three components of an MVP:
    • Person class
    • PersonView and PersonPresenter classes
The Person class represents the model, the PersonView class the view, and the PersonPresenter class
the presenter. As required by the MVP pattern, the Person class will be agnostic about the PersonView and
the PersonPresenter classes. The PersonView and the PersonPresenter classes will interact with each other
and they will use the Person class directly.

A press-drag-release gesture is a user action of pressing a mouse button, dragging the mouse with the pressed
button, and releasing the button. The gesture can be initiated on a scene or a node. Several nodes and scenes
may participate in a single press-drag-release gesture. The gesture is capable of generating different types of
events and delivering those events to different nodes. The type of generated events and nodes receiving the
events depends on the purpose of the gesture. A node can be dragged for different purposes:
    • You may want to change the shape of a node by dragging its boundaries or move it
    by dragging it to a new location. In this case, the gesture involves only one node: the
    node on which the gesture was initiated.
    • You may want to drag a node and drop it onto another node to connect them in
    some fashion, for example, connecting two nodes with a symbol in a flow chart. In
    this case, the drag gesture involves multiple nodes. When the source node is dropped
    onto the target node, an action takes place.
    • You can drag a node and drop it onto another node to transfer data from the source
    node to the target node. In this case, the drag gesture involves multiple nodes. A data
    transfer occurs when the source node is dropped.

JavaFX supports three types of drag gestures:
    • A simple press-drag-release gesture
    • A full press-drag-release gesture
    • A drag-and-drop gesture

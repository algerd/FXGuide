All transition classes inherit from the Transition class, which, in turn, inherits from the Animation
class. All methods and properties in the Animation class are also available for use in creating transitions.
The transition classes take care of creating the key frames and setting up the timeline. You need to specify
the node, duration for the animation, and end values that are interpolated. Special transition classes are
available to combine multiple animations that may run sequentially or in parallel.

The Transition class contains an interpolator property that specifies the interpolator to be used
during animation. By default, it uses Interpolator.EASE_BOTH, which starts the animation slowly,
accelerates it, and slows it down toward the end.

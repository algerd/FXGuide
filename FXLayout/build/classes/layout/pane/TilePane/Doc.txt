The List of Properties Declared in the TilePane Class:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Property            Type                    Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
alignment       ObjectProperty<Pos>     It specifies the alignment of the content of the TilePane
                                        relative to its content area. It defaults to Pos.TOP_LEFT.
                                        tileAlignment ObjectProperty<Pos> It specifies the default alignment of all children within their
                                        tiles. It defaults to Pos.CENTER.

hgap, vgap      DoubleProperty          The hgap property specifies the horizontal gap between
                                        adjacent children in a row. The vgap property specifies the
                                        vertical gap between adjacent children in a column. The
                                        default is zero for both properties.

orientation     ObjectProperty          It specifies the orientation of the TilePane â€“ horizontal
                <Orientation>           or vertical. It defaults to HORIZONTAL.

prefRows        IntegerProperty         It specifies the preferred number of rows for a vertical
                                        TilePane. It is ignored for a horizontal TilePane.

prefColumns     IntegerProperty         It specifies the preferred number of columns for a
                                        horizontal TilePane. It is ignored for a vertical TilePane.

prefTileWidth   DoubleProperty          It specifies the preferred width of each tile. The default is to
                                        use the width of the widest children.

prefTileHeight  DoubleProperty          It specifies the preferred height of each tile. The default is to
                                        use the height of the tallest children.

tileHeight      ReadOnlyDoubleProperty  It is a read-only property that stores the actual height of
                                        each tile.

tileWidth       ReadOnlyDoubleProperty  It is a read-only property that stores the actual width of
                                        each tile.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The orientation property specifies the flow of content in a TilePane. If it is set to Orientation.HORIZONTAL,
which is the default value, the content flows in rows. If it is set to Orientation.VERTICAL, the content flows
in columns. You can specify the orientation in the constructors or using the setter method.
    // Create a horizontal TilePane
    TilePane tpane = new TilePane();
    ...
    // Change the orientation of the TilePane to vertical
    tpane.setOrientation(Orientation.VERTICAL);


A TilePane computes the preferred size of its tiles based on the widest and the tallest children. You can
override the computed width and height of tiles using the prefTileWidth and prefTileHeight properties.
They default to Region.USE_COMPUTED_SIZE. The TilePane attempts to resize its children to fit in the tile size,
provided their minimum and maximum size allows them to be resized.
    // Create a TilePane and set its preferred tile width and height to 40px
    TilePane tpane = new TilePane();
    tpane.setPrefTileWidth(40);
    tpane.setPrefTileHeight(40);


The prefRows property specifies the preferred number of rows for a vertical TilePane. It is ignored for a
horizontal TilePane.
The prefColumns specifies the preferred number of columns for a horizontal TilePane. It is ignored for
a vertical TilePane.
The default values for prefRows and prefColumns is 5. It is recommended that you use a sensible value
for these properties.
Note that these properties are only used to compute the preferred size of the TilePane. If the TilePane
is resized to a size other than its preferred size, these values may not reflect the actual number of rows or
columns. 
Tip: Recall the prefWrapLength property of the FlowPane that is used to determine the preferred width or
height of the FlowPane. The prefRows and prefColumns properties serve the same purpose in a TilePane,
as does the prefWrapLength in a FlowPane.

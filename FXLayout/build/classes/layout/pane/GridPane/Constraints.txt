An object of the ColumnConstraints class represents constraints for a column and an object of the
RowConstraints class represents constraints for a row. Both classes declare several properties that represent
the constraints.

The List of Properties for the ColumnConstraints Class:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Property            Type                Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
fillWidth    BooleanProperty        It specifies whether the children in the column are expanded beyond
                                    their preferred width to fill the width of the column. The default value
                                    is true.

halignment  ObjectProperty<HPos>    It specifies the default horizontal alignment of the children in a
                                    column. Its default value is null. By default, all children in a column
                                    are horizontally aligned to HPos.LEFT. An individual child node in the
                                    column may override this constraint.

hgrow   ObjectProperty<Priority>    It specifies the horizontal grow priority for the column. This property
                                    is used to give additional space to the column when the GridPane is
                                    resized larger than its preferred width. If the percentWidth property
                                    is set, the value for this property is ignored.

minWidth,   DoubleProperty          They specify the minimum, preferred, and maximum widths of the
prefWidth,                          column. If the percentWidth property is set, the values for these
maxWidth                            properties are ignored.
                                    The default values for these properties are set to USE_COMPUTED_SIZE.
                                    By default, the minimum width of a column is the largest of the
                                    minimum widths of children in the column; the preferred width is
                                    the largest of the preferred widths of children in the column; and, the
                                    maximum width is the smallest of the maximum widths of children in
                                    the column.

percentWidth DoubleProperty         It specifies the width percentage of the column relative to the width
                                    of the content area of the GridPane. If it is set to a value greater than
                                    zero, the column is resized to have the width that is this percentage
                                    of the available width of the GridPane. If this property is set, the
                                    minWidth, prefWidth, maxWidth, and hgrow properties are ignored.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Properties for the RowConstraints Class
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Property            Type                Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
fillHeight      BooleanProperty         It specifies whether the children in the row are expanded beyond
                                        their preferred height to fill the height of the row. The default value
                                        is true.

valignment      ObjectProperty<HPos>    It specifies the default vertical alignment of the children in a row. Its
                                        default value is null. By default, all children in a row are vertically
                                        aligned to VPos.CENTER. An individual child node in the row may
                                        override this constraint.

vgrow       ObjectProperty<Priority>    It specifies the vertical grow priority for the row. This property
                                        is used to give additional space to the row when the GridPane
                                        is resized larger than its preferred height. If the percentHeight
                                        property is set, the value for this property is ignored.

minHeight,      DoubleProperty          They specify the minimum, preferred, and maximum heights of
prefHeight,                             the row. If the percentHeight property is set, the values for these
maxHeight                               properties are ignored.    
                                        The default values for these properties are set to USE_COMPUTED_SIZE.
                                        By default, the minimum height of a row is the largest of the
                                        minimum heights of children in the row; the preferred height is
                                        the largest of the preferred heights of children in the row; and, the
                                        maximum height is the smallest of the maximum heights of children
                                        in the row.

percentHeight   DoubleProperty          It specifies the height percentage of the row relative to the height of
                                        the content area of the GridPane. If it is set to a value greater than
                                        zero, the row is resized to have the height that is this percentage
                                        of the available height for the GridPane. If this property is set, the
                                        minHeight, prefHeight, maxHeight, and vgrow properties are
                                        ignored.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ColumnConstraints and RowConstraints classes provide several constructors to create their
objects. Their no-args constructors create their objects with default property values.

    // Create a ColumnConstraints object with default property values
    ColumnConstraints cc1 = new ColumnConstraints();
    // Set the percentWidth to 30% and horizontal alignment to center
    cc1.setPercentWidth(30);
    cc1.setHalignment(HPos.CENTER);

If you want to create a fixed width/height column/row, you can use one of the convenience contractors.

    // Create a ColumnConstraints object with a fixed column width of 100px
    ColumnConstraints cc2 = new ColumnConstraints(100);
    // Create a RowConstraints object with a fixed row height of 80px
    RowConstraints rc2 = new RowConstraints(80);

If you want to achieve the same effect of having a fixed width column, you can do so by setting the
preferred width to the desired fixed width value and setting the minimum and maximum widths to use the
preferred width as shown below.

    // Create a ColumnConstraints object with a fixed column width of 100px
    ColumnConstraints cc3 = new ColumnConstraints();
    cc3.setPrefWidth(100);
    cc3.setMinWidth(Region.USE_PREF_SIZE);
    cc3.setMaxWidth(Region.USE_PREF_SIZE);


The following snippet of code sets the column width to 30% of the GridPane width and the horizontal
alignment for the children in the column as center.

    ColumnConstraints cc4 = new ColumnConstraints();
    cc4.setPercentWidth(30); // 30% width
    cc4.setHalignment(HPos.CENTER);

In a GridPane, the width/height of different columns/rows may be computed differently. Some
columns/row may set percent width/height, some fixed sizes, and some may choose to compute their sizes
based on their content. The percent size is given the first preference in allocating the space. For example,
if two columns set their widths based on percentage and one uses a fixed width, the available width will be
allocated first to the two columns using the percentage width, and then, to the column using the fixed width.

Tip: It is possible that the sum of the percentage width/height of all columns/rows exceeds 100.
For example, it is permissible to set the percentage width of columns in a GridPane to 30%, 30%, 30%, and
30%. In this case, the percentage value is used as weights and each of the four columns will be given
one-fourth (30/120) of the available width. As an another example, if columns use 30%, 30%, 60%, and 60% as
percentage width, they will be treated as weights, allocating them one-sixth (30/180), one-sixth (30/180),
one-third (60/180), and one-third (60/180) of the available width, respectively.

A GridPane stores the constraints for columns and rows in ObservableList of ColumnConstraints
and RowConstraints. You can obtain the reference of the lists using the getColumnConstraints() and
getRowConstraints() methods. The element at a particular index in the list stores the constraints object
for the column/row at the same index in the GridPane. The first element in the list, for example, stores the
column/row constraints for the first column/row, the second elements for the second column/row, etc. It is
possible to set the column/row constraints for some column/row, not for others. In this case, the constraints
for column/row for which the column/row constraints are absent will be computed based on the default
values. The following snippet of code creates three ColumnConstraints objects, sets their properties, and
adds them to the list of column constraints of a GridPane. Using RowConstraints objects for setting row
constraints would use the similar logic.

When you set column/row constraints, you cannot skip some columns/rows in the middle. That is,
you must set the constraints for columns/rows sequentially starting from the first column/row. Setting null
for a constraint’s object throws a NullPointerException at runtime. If you want to skip setting custom
constraints for a row/column in the list, set it to a constraints object that is created using the no-args
constructor, which will use the default settings. The following snippet of code sets the column constraints for
the first three columns. The second column uses default settings for the constraints.

    // With 100px fied width
    ColumnConstraints cc1 = new ColumnConstraints(100);
    // Use all default settings
    ColumnConstraints defaultCc2 = new ColumnConstraints();
    // With 200px fied width
    ColumnConstraints cc3 = new ColumnConstraints(200);
    GridPane gpane = new GridPane();
    gpane.getColumnConstraints().addAll(cc1, defaultCc2, cc3);

Tip: Some column/row constraints set on a column/row can be overridden by children in the column/row
individually. Some constraints can be set on children in a column/row and may affect the entire column/row.

Table lists the constraints that can be set for the children in a GridPane. The GridPane class contains
two sets of static methods to set these constraints:
    • The setConstraints() methods
    • The setXxx(Node child, CType cvalue) methods, where Xxx is the constraint name and CType is its type
To remove a constraint for a child node, set it to null

List of Constraints That Can Be Set for the Children in a GridPane:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Constraint      Type                Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
columnIndex     Integer     It is the column index where the layout area of the child node starts. The first
                            column has the index 0. The default value is 0.
rowIndex        Integer     It is the row index where the layout area of the child node starts. The first row
                            has the index 0. The default value is 0.
columnSpan      Integer     It is the number of columns the layout area of a child node spans. The default is 1.
rowSpan         Integer     It is the number of columns the layout area of a child node spans. The default is 1.
halignment      HPos        It specifies the horizontal alignment of the child node within its layout area.
valignment      VPos        It specifies the vertical alignment of the child node within its layout area.
hgrow           Priority    It specifies the horizontal grow priority of the child node.
vgrow           Priority    It specifies the vertical grow priority of the child node.
margin          Insets      It specifies the margin space around the outside of the layout bounds of the
                            child node.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the setMargin(Node child, Insets value) static method of the GridPane class to set the margin
(the space around the layout bounds) for children. The getMargin(Node child) static method returns the
margin for a child node.
    // Set 10px margin around the b1 child node
    GridPane.setMargin(b1, new Insets(10));
    ...
    // Get the margin of the b1 child node
    Insets margin = GridPane.getMargin(b1);
Use null to reset the margin to the default value, which is zero.

Use the clearConstraints(Node child) static method of the GridPane class to reset all constraints
(columnIndex, rowIndex, columnSpan, rowSpan, halignment, valignment, hgrow, vgrow, margin) for a child at
once.
    // Clear all constraints for the b1 child node
    GridPane.clearConstraints(b1);

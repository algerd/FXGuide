The List of Properties Declared in the FlowPane Class:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Property            Type                    Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
alignment           ObjectProperty<Pos>     It specifies the alignment of rows and columns relative
                                            to the content area of the FlowPane. The default value is
                                            Pos.TOP_LEFT.

rowValignment       ObjectProperty<VPos>    It specifies the vertical alignment of the children within
                                            each row in a horizontal FlowPane. It is ignored for a
                                            vertical FlowPane.

columnHalignment    ObjectProperty<HPos>   It specifies the horizontal alignment of the children
                                            within each column in a vertical FlowPane. It is ignored
                                            for a horizontal FlowPane.

hgap, vgap          DoubleProperty          They specify the horizontal and vertical gaps between
                                            children. The default is zero.

orientation         ObjectProperty<Orientation>     It specifies the orientation of the FlowPane. It defaults
                                            to HORIZONTAL.

prefWrapLength      DoubleProperty          It is the preferred width in a horizontal FlowPane and
                                            the preferred height in a vertical FlowPane where the
                                            content should wrap. The default is 400.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The prefWrapLength property is the preferred width in a horizontal FlowPane or the preferred height in
a vertical FlowPane where content should wrap. This is only used to compute the preferred size of the
FlowPane. It defaults to 400. Treat the value of this property as a hint to resize your FlowPane. Suppose you
set this value to less than the largest preferred width or height of a child node. In this case, this value will not
be respected, as a row cannot be shorter than the widest child node in a horizontal FlowPane or a column
cannot be shorter than the tallest child node in a vertical FlowPane. If 400px is too wide or tall for your
FlowPane, set this value to a reasonable value.

Using the hgap and vgap properties is straightforward. In a horizontal FlowPane, the hgap property specifies
the horizontal spacing between adjacent children in a row and the vgap property specifies the spacing
between adjacent rows. In a vertical FlowPane, the hgap property specifies the horizontal spacing between
adjacent columns and the vgap property specifies the spacing between adjacent children in a column. You
can set these properties in the constructors or using the setter methods. 
    // Create a FlowPane with 5px hgap and 10px vgap
    FlowPane fpane = new FlowPane(5, 10);
    // Change the hgap to 15px and vgap to 25px
    fpane.setHgap(15);
    fpane.setVgap(25);

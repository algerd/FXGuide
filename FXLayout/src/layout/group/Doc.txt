Group is used to manipulate a collection of nodes as a single node (or as a group).
Transformations, effects, and properties applied to a Group are applied to all nodes in the Group.
A Group has its own layout policy, which does not provide any specific layout to its children, except
giving them their preferred size:
    • It renders nodes in the order they are added.
    • It does not position its children. All children are positioned at (0, 0) by default. You
        need to write code to position child nodes of a Group. Use the layoutX and layoutY
        properties of the children nodes to position them within the Group.
    • By default, it resizes all its children to their preferred size. The auto-sizing behavior
        can be disabled by setting its autoSizeChildren property to false. Note that if you
        disable the auto-sizing property, all nodes, except shapes, will be invisible as their
        size will be zero, by default.
A Group does not have a size of its own. It is not resizable directly. Its size is the collective bounds
of its children. Its bounds change, as the bounds of any or all of its children change.
